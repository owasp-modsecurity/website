Yes! As a project in order to support activities like summits, hackathons, and speaking at conferences we need sponsors. If you appreciate the work we do, or you use it heavily, you should consider sponsoring. If you are interested, please get 
in touch with CRS Co-Lead Christian Folini via christian.folini /at/ netnea.com. He is in charge of sponsoring contacts.
