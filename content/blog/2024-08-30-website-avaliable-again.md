After a long period, the [modsecurity.org](https://modsecurity.org) website is available again with renewed content and form.

<!--more-->

When Trustwave handed over control of the [project](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/01/09/ModSecurity) in [January](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trustwave-transfers-modsecurity-custodianship-to-the-open-worldwide-application-security-project/), they indicated that they needed the domain while they continued to support their products.

The time has come, after July 1st we started the transfer of domain ownership.

A few days ago, all the processes were completed, and finally we are able to publish the new website. Thanks to all participants from Trustwave and OWASP for their help.

Our goal is to communicate all important news and development-related information here in the future.
