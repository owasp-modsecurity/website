    [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) is an open source, cross-platform web application firewall (WAF) module. 
    Known as the "Swiss Army Knife" of WAFs, it enables web application defenders to gain 
    visibility into HTTP(S) traffic and provides a power rules language and API to implement 
    advanced protections.

    Used by businesses, government organizations, internet service providers, and commercial WAF vendors alike on 
    millions of domains all over the world. The engine, coupled with OWASP CRS - the dominant WAF rule set, 
    undeniably raises the level of protection against HTTP attacks to a higher level.
